# ambient-sound-and-marine-mammal-contribution-analysis
Matlab code to analyse and plot ocean ambient sound spectra based on a set of sound recordings

This code was used to analyse a set of wav files from  2 automonous recorders moored in the Southern Ocean. The results are presented and discussed in the paper "The influence of sea ice, wind speed and marine mammals on Southern Ocean ambient sound", wich is currently under submission to Royal Society Open Science. Once published, furher information will follow here.
